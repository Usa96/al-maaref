      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        At Al Maaref Private School (AMPS), the Student Council serves as the official voice of the student body, representing ideas, opinions, and concerns to school leadership.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Its purpose is to foster leadership, responsibility, and active participation. The council meets regularly to plan and implement school-wide initiatives that promote student engagement and positive change.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Led by an elected President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary—with Class Representatives across all grade levels—the council ensures every student has a voice.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>Promote leadership and communication skills</li>
        <li>Plan school events, service projects, and awareness campaigns</li>
        <li>Encourage student input in decision-making</li>
        <li>Support initiatives that strengthen school values</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        At AMPS, we believe in empowering students to take ownership of their educational journey—and the Student Council plays a vital role in that mission.
